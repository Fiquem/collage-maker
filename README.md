i wanna make a collage

## steps
- ~~upload images~~
- ~~display images~~
- ~~create image by combining images~~
- ~~download img~~
- ~~interact with canvas to move images~~
- ~~interact with canvas to scale images~~
- combine in nice ways
- ~~upload multiple images at once~~
- make page be nice to use
- make work on mobile
- add canvas size changer
- ~~stop images moving out of the collage box (e.g. scrolling to not fix box, moving outside bounds)~~

## bugs
- ~~if image is smaller than canvas (or i mb area of canvas it's given?)~~
- ~~scale doesn't focus currently hovered image, just last clicked~~
- gets real slow with 9 medium-large images
- ~~the scroll doesn't actually choose correctly, gotta get that for canvas not window (scrolling down breaks)~~
- oh this is like full broken on pc
- ~~moves slow when image is small~~
